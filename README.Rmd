## Overview

**seekr** is an R package designed to help you search for specific patterns within text files.

## Installation

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# Install it directly from CRAN:
install.packages("seekr")

# Or the the development version from GitHub:
# install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("smartiing/seekr")
```

## Functions

**seekr** provides two main functions:

- `seek()`: Search for a pattern in files within a specified directory.
- `seek_in()`: Search for a pattern in a given list of files.

Each function returns a tibble with the following columns:

- `path`: Path to the file (relative or absolute).
- `line_number`: Line number where the pattern was found.
- `match`: The first match found in the line.
- `matches`: All matches found in the line (if matches = TRUE).
- `line`: Content of the matching line.


## Example

```{r}
library(seekr)

path = system.file("extdata", package = "seekr")

# Search all function definitions in R files
seek("[^\\s]+(?= (=|<-) function\\()", path, filter = "\\.R$")

# Search for usage of "TODO" comments in source code in a case insensitive way
seek("(?i)TODO", path, filter = "\\.R$")

# Search for error/warning in log files
seek("(?i)error", path, filter = "\\.log$")

# Search for config keys in YAML
seek("database:", path, filter = "\\.ya?ml$")

# Looking for "length" in all types of text files
seek("(?i)length", path)

# Search for specific CSV headers using seek_in() and reading only the first line
csv_files <- list.files(path, "\\.csv$", full.names = TRUE)
seek_in(csv_files, "(?i)specie", n_max = 1)
```
