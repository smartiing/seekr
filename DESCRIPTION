Description: Provides a simple interface to recursively list files from a
    directory, filter them using a regular expression, read their
    contents, and extract lines that match a user-defined pattern. The
    package returns a dataframe containing the matched lines, their
    line numbers, file paths, and the corresponding matched substrings.
    Designed for quick code base exploration, log inspection, or any use
    case involving pattern-based file and line filtering.
